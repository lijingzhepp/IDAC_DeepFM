# IDAC_DeepFM
This repository was created to share the application of DeepFM algorithm for the infinite dilution activity coefficients (IDAC) prediction of moleclar solutes in green solvents including ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs).

## Installation of the packages
The deepFM model was under the environment that could be installed by "my-deepFM-cpu-env-2.yml" and the chemical fragmentation of ILs&DESs was under the environment that could be installed by "my-rdkit-env.yml" under the **Environment** folder.

## Citation
The deepFM model was constructed using the "deepfm" module in DeepCTR by Weichen Shen. (2017). DeepCTR: Easy-to-use,Modular and Extendible package of deep-learning based CTR models. https://github.com/shenweichen/deepctr.
