# IDAC_DeepFM
This repository was created to share the application of DeepFM model for the infinite dilution activity coefficients (IDAC) prediction of moleclar solutes in green solvents including ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs).

## Installation of the packages
The deepFM model was under the environment that could be imported by "my-deepFM-cpu-env-2.yml" and the chemical fragmentation of ILs&DESs was under the environment that could be imported by "my-rdkit-env.yml" under the **Environment** folder.

## Database and training scripts
The database and the training script that were used for training the DeepFM model was included under **Database and training scripts** folder.

## Developed Model
The developed model was included under **** folder.
