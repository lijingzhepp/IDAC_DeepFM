1. The best model that was discussed in the publication in the Citation section of the README.md file was included as the **DeepFM_dnn(512, 256, 256)_embedding5_lr0.001_bs256_drop0_l2l1e-05_l2e1e-05_l2d0_cv8_rep1_model.h5** file. Please refer to the **Database and training scripts** folder for detailed model development.
2. This model could be utilized in the determination of IDACs of molecular solutes in green solvents at various temperatures. 
3. To utilize the model for IDAC prediction, the required environment should be imported by the **my-deepFM-cpu-env-2.yml** file under the **Environment** folder.
4. The **Make_IDAC_Prediction.ipynb** file or the **Make_IDAC_Prediction.py** file could be used to conduct the IDAC prediction for the solvent and solute combination at various temperatures in the **Sample.csv** file. The IDAC prediction results was ensembled in the **Predicted_IDAC.xlsx** file. The **Make_IDAC_Prediction.ipynb** file and the **Make_IDAC_Prediction.py** file contain notes for each block of codes.
