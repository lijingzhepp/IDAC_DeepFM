1. The deepFM model was under the environment that could be imported by the **my-deepFM-cpu-env-2.yml** file. Please refer to the **Environment** folder.
2. The database used for the model development was included in the **Data_01032022_Shuffled.csv** file. In the **Data_01032022_Shuffled.csv** file, the column1 includes ln(IDAC) value. The column2 includes tempearture in K. The column3 includes molecular weight for solvent. The column4 includes molecular weight for solute. The column5 to column9 include solute Abraham solvation parameters (i.e. E, S, A, B, L). The column10 includes solvent id. The column11 includes solue id. The column12 to column97 include solvent descriptors that were listed in Table S2 of the published SI file in the **Citation** section of the **README.md** file. The column98 to column137 include solvent descriptors that were listed in Table S3 of the published SI file in the **Citation** section of the **README.md** file.
3. The model development/training could be conducted by running the **IDAC_DeepFM_Training.ipynb** file or the **IDAC_DeepFM_Training.py** file.
